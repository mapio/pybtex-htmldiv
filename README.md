Pybtex htmldiv backend plugin
=============================

This is a simple [pybtex](http://pybtex.sourceforge.net/) plugin (heavily
based on the standard html backend) that can be used to emit entires wrapped
in a div of given class (without preample and postamble).

It can be useful to convert single entries, to embed them in web pages. See
the provided [exmaple](blob/master/example/example.py) as a hint on how to use
it.
