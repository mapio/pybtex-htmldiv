Pybtex htmldiv backend plugin
=============================

This is a simple [pybtex](http://pybtex.sourceforge.net/) plugin (heavily
based on the standard html backend) that can be used to emit entires wrapped
in a `div` of given `class` (without *preample* and *postamble*).

It can be useful to convert single entries for embeding in html pages. See
the provided [exmaple](/example/example.py) as a hint on how to use
it.
